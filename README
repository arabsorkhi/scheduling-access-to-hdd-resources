Simulation of disk access planning algorithms.
- 'Disk' in our case is a linearly ordered sequence of blocks from 1 to MAX.
- The criterion for evaluating the algorithms will be the sum of the displacements of the disk head, as is known, proportional to the time of execution of orders.
1.Check the FCFS, SSTF, SCAN and C-SCAN algorithms.
2. Then assume that there are also real-time applications in the system that must be handled with EDF and / or FD-SCAN. How does this affect the results?
ATTENTION!
It is up to you to formulate simulation conditions not listed above. I mean:
-the size of the 'disk' (number of blocks)
-number and method of generating tickets (full queue from the beginning? tickets in progress? distribution of tickets - even, different?
- how to handle real-time requests
